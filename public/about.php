			Hello and welcome to my blog! I built this for the purpose of storing rants about my life ranging from food, coding, web development, social interaction, pop culture, and random thoughts. It is like my very own treehouse of fun. Contents may content vulgarity, unfiltered bluntness, and sarcasm so if you feel offended by anything I have to say, then you are free to leave. I may have the decency to censor some depravity as some potential employers will be lurking here to take a peek of what I am all about.
		</p>
		<p>
			All warnings aside, I am a twenty-something year old web developer in LA, trying to find my place in the tech world. I am by no means an expert, in <em>anything</em>, in fact I am as noobish as you might expect, but I am here to learn, build, and excel. I have a dog child named Yoda [left] and he is my meaning of life. I love to travel, eat, and play with my dog and if I can have things my way I will only be doing so. Happy reading!
